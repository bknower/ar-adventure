# Husky Hunt AR Adventure

This project was made for Husky Hunt, Northeastern University's 24-hour scavenger hunt around Boston. Every year, 50 teams of 12 people each compete to complete challenges, find clues, and do crafts.

In this game, you must complete a series of 8 quests, each based on a sign of the Zodiac, by walking around campus to visit virtual markers, talking to NPCs, and collecting and using items.

Try it out for yourself [here](https://hh-ar-adventure.vercel.app/) (you need to be on the Northeastern campus to play it).
